## Data

**This data was not created by Data Curator.**

### Why was the data created?

The data was created to help people discover Australian open data publishers and portals.

### When was the data collected?

Data is crowdsourced and is gradually collected over time.

### Where was the data collected?

The data is sourced from:

- https://data.gov.au/organization where the organisation has published one or more open datasets
- https://opencouncildata.org/australia/
- contributions

### How was the data collected?

The data is collected by visiting open data portals. `URL` and `organisation` fields come from the site.

`portal` is determined by inspecting the web pages or source code.

- The location `lat` and `lon` are manually determined. For:
   - local portals the location is the organisation's office
   - State, Territory or National organisations the location is the centroid of the geographic area
